"""Slim live MVP runner (S4): one honest scored run, M2 -> M3 -> adapter -> M4/M5 -> M6.

    python -m vera.run_mvp --question-id N --stage {A,B,C,L1} --run-type {test,live} [--live ...]

DEFAULT IS DRY/OFFLINE: without --live this module runs the offline pre-flight only (no .env load, no
DB, no provider call) and prints what it would do. A live run needs the explicit --live flag AND
--budget-confirmed AND every pre-flight check to pass (checked again inside run_mvp before any
write or spend). Nothing here is executed live by the tests; every seam is injected through Deps.

Rules (plan vera-plan-slim-live-mvp.md sections 2, 4, 13, 15):
  * one RunBudget covers M2..M5 (cost and wall-clock); its checks run OUTSIDE Gate A (Gate A swallows
    exceptions) and outside any other code that catches broad exceptions;
  * after build_engineered the runner calls attach_usage (build_engineered drops usage.complete);
  * unknown cost anywhere means incomplete usage: stop BEFORE M6 with exit 4 (checked after M2 and after
    M3 when M6 is planned, so known-incomplete usage does not keep spending);
  * the judge is chosen once by pre-flight (select_judge) and fixed for the run; the selection is
    recorded; the judge transport is always passed explicitly;
  * every stage writes as the rw account; its identity is asserted before the first write;
  * failures are verbose: the report holds stage, cause and traceback (scrubbed), and a report-write
    failure is raised only AFTER the original error was logged.
Exit codes: 0 closed_ok, 1 preflight_failed, 2 stage failed, 3 budget stop, 4 usage incomplete.
